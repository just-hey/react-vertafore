# Your React To Do App

Currently there are a few bugs with this app! We can make use of state to see what items are complete and will soon be able to add new items to our list (thanks to you, of course).

### Your to do list:
- Look around the code base and try to understand how the different components interact
  > There are lines of code/functions missing or that are incomplete
- The main objective here is to understand how the different components interact! A stretch goal is to implement a way to add new to do items to your list. I understand that everyone has different backgrounds and knowledge, remember: baby steps is how everyone starts.


This app does not make use of Router or Redux. It is to help set a `baseline` understanding of how React.js works and how to leverage _prop drilling_.
